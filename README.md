# Grades
Simple grades app . 
I'm using SQL Server to store data ( id , grade , name ) . 

Interaction with the database is described in grade.cs : 
Select () method to show all data from database ; 
Insert () method to add new student to a database (id generating automatically) ; 
Update () method to update the grade (at this point i dont want to make an opportunity to change names) ; 
Delete () method to remove data from database (removing by ID) ; 

// To do : 
// Change variables names (buttons , table) . 
// Change TryParse , some inputs causing errors .
